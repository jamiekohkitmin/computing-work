#**My Life in the Classroom** 

#_Introduction of me_
Hi! I am Beary Cute, you can call me Mr Cute! I am a Mathematics Teacher teaching at Peachy Lovely School. I am sure all my students love me, well, I hope so.

#_A typical day in school_ 
Rushing into the noisy and cluttered classroom, I bellowed, "Class, take out your small exercise book, we have a very tight scheduele today!" 
A nagging sense of paranoia overwhelmed me as I heard a few students shooting a plethora of vulgarities out of their mouths. 
Are they cursing at me? What did I do wrong? 
"Ok class, we are going to learn about linear graphs today, please take out your 1A Math Textbook." 
Upon hearing that, a few students took out their textbooks, only a few. It's always that few diligent ones.
I thought to myself, "What have I ever done to receive this treatment? I try my best every day, but why is it not appreciated? Why am I not respected?"

"Life in class is so interesting."
